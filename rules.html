	    		It's Tic-Tac-Toe (sort of).
	    	</p>
	</div>

	<p class="rulesp"> Each turn place a bid by typing some number from 0 to however many chips you have. The computer also makes a bid (without knowledge of yours). You pay the computer your bid and the computer pays you its bid. The player who bids more get to make a move. Rinse and Repeat.</p>

	<p class="rulesp"> Occassionally the player and the computer submit the same bid. In this case, whoever has the most chips wins the move. If the player and the computer have the same number of chips, the tie goes to the player.</p>

	<p class="rulesp"> Now <a href="index">Play</a>! </p>
